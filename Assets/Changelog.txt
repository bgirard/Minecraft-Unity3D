[New] Game now can determine if player is in a particular block. Can be used for damage, water effects, or other special block features.

[New] Core block is now generated at the bottom to prevent player from falling under chunks.
[New] Sand block. Not used for now.
[New] A new sky system based on a layered spherical object with shaders. Supports dynamic movement of the sun, stars, and clouds. (Used DMeville/DMSkybox from it's githhub.)
