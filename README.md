# Unity Voxel Community Project

![Screenshot](./Assets/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This project is a fork from [Sam Hogan's Minecraft in 24 hours](https://youtu.be/Nj8gt_92c-M).

The aim of this project is to build a game for fun of the development. The end project is just a means
to that end. I encourage anyone to contribute anything they feel will make this project better. There's
no vision or design. I recommend just playing the project, thinking of an element that's easy to add
that would improve the game and send a pull request.

So far the following improvements have been made:

- Terrain Chunk Generation is now multi-thread and out of the render loop to fix the lag.
- Added a chase AI.
- Basic chase zombie.
- Viking model for the main player.
- Update nearby chunks when updating terran to fix visual errors.
- Day/Night cycle

# Contributing

My plan is to accept every PR that incrementally makes the game better and is of game jam acceptable code quality. If there's enough interest in the project then we can discuss and evolve the guidelines.
